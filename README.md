Once logged in, make sure your Redis server is running and connect your Redis database by entering its IP address, port number, and Redis auth password. If you have not configured your Redis Server to require a password, leave the password input field blank as the app can connect without it. Upon successful connection, use the navigation menu to view performance metrics of your Redis instance.
